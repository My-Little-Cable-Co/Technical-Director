# MyLittleCableCo/Technical-Director

The technical director is responsible for queueing and playing videos. It
consults the [Scheduler](https://github.com/My-Little-Cable-Co/Scheduler) to
know what should be playing, and intersperses commercials to fill the
timeslot.

This project is a python program that uses python-vlc bindings to control a VLC
instance.
